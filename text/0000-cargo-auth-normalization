- Feature Name: cargo_auth_normalization
- Start Date: 2021-05-19
- RFC PR: [rust-lang/rfcs#0000](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/0000)
- Rust Issue: [rust-lang/rust#9494](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/9494)

# Summary
[summary]: #summary

Following the credentials-process, enable private registries by normalizing and expanding the handling of authentication across registries and downloads in a future-proof way.

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

Initially, the issue was a jfrog private artifactory behind a proxy almost, but didn't quite, work. Delving into it, some inconsistencies were noticed, other multi-year open RFCs, and it's time to stick a fork in it.

# Guide-level explanation
[guide-level-explanation]: #guide-level-explanation

Enterprises with tight security policies around who can read and write source who endeavor to maintain logged and authenticated access to their source use are a bit screwed.

This proposal adds the ability to configure different headers associated with each registry, and to populate header values with credentials.toml or credentials-process generated tokens under https.

Example: 

~/.cargo/config.toml

[registry]
default = "my-special-registry"

[registries]
my-special-registry = { index = "https://server/somepath.git" } # contains a mirror of crates.io that has been deemed 'blessed', plus some enterprise-common source.
crates-io-direct = { index = "http://crates.io" } # second level availability for development, but can't be used for production.
my-super-secret-registry = { index = "https://server/someotherpath.git" } # the secret sauce

[source.crates-io]
replace-with = "my-special-registry"

[registries.crates-io-direct]
 # In production, use a bogus name
 # replace-with = "do_not_check_in_crates_io_dependencies_jerkface"
registry = { index = "http://crates.io" } 
dl = "http://crates.io"
api = "http://crates.io"
http = {proxy = "socks5://myproxy:8908"}

[source.my-special-registry]
registry = "https://server/somepath.git"
http = { proxy = "socks5://myinternalproxy:8080" }

# Even if the super-secret-registry returned some values for dl and api, we're overriding them.
[source.my-super-secret-registry]
dl = "https://server/someotherotherpath.git"
api = "https://server/someotherotherpath.git"
net = {git-fetch-with-cli = true}

Credentials.toml:

[registries.my-special-registry.update]
headers = {"Authentication": "Bearer biglongtoken"}

[registries.my-special-registry.index]
headers = {"Authentication": "simpletoken"}

[registries.my-special-registry.download]
headers = {"Authentication": "simpletoken"}

# Reference-level explanation
[reference-level-explanation]: #reference-level-explanation

This is the technical portion of the RFC. Explain the design in sufficient detail that:

- Its interaction with other features is clear.
- It is reasonably clear how the feature would be implemented.
- Corner cases are dissected by example.

The section should return to the examples given in the previous section, and explain more fully how the detailed proposal makes those examples work.

# Drawbacks
[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this?

# Rationale and alternatives
[rationale-and-alternatives]: #rationale-and-alternatives

- Why is this design the best in the space of possible designs?
- What other designs have been considered and what is the rationale for not choosing them?
- What is the impact of not doing this?

# Prior art
[prior-art]: #prior-art

Discuss prior art, both the good and the bad, in relation to this proposal.
A few examples of what this can include are:

- For language, library, cargo, tools, and compiler proposals: Does this feature exist in other programming languages and what experience have their community had?
- For community proposals: Is this done by some other community and what were their experiences with it?
- For other teams: What lessons can we learn from what other communities have done here?
- Papers: Are there any published papers or great posts that discuss this? If you have some relevant papers to refer to, this can serve as a more detailed theoretical background.

This section is intended to encourage you as an author to think about the lessons from other languages, provide readers of your RFC with a fuller picture.
If there is no prior art, that is fine - your ideas are interesting to us whether they are brand new or if it is an adaptation from other languages.

Note that while precedent set by other languages is some motivation, it does not on its own motivate an RFC.
Please also take into consideration that rust sometimes intentionally diverges from common language features.

# Unresolved questions
[unresolved-questions]: #unresolved-questions

- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the RFC process before this gets merged?
- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the implementation of this feature before stabilization?
- What related issues do you consider out of scope for this RFC that could be addressed in the future independently of the solution that comes out of this RFC?

# Future possibilities
[future-possibilities]: #future-possibilities

Think about what the natural extension and evolution of your proposal would
be and how it would affect the language and project as a whole in a holistic
way. Try to use this section as a tool to more fully consider all possible
interactions with the project and language in your proposal.
Also consider how this all fits into the roadmap for the project
and of the relevant sub-team.

This is also a good place to "dump ideas", if they are out of scope for the
RFC you are writing but otherwise related.

If you have tried and cannot think of any future possibilities,
you may simply state that you cannot think of anything.

Note that having something written down in the future-possibilities section
is not a reason to accept the current or a future RFC; such notes should be
in the section on motivation or rationale in this or subsequent RFCs.
The section merely provides additional information.
